==================================================

USNET currently has support for NAPT.  This form of NAT assumes that hosts
on the internal LAN will initiate TCP or UDP communictations with hosts
on the extnernal WAN through the USNET NAT router.  For outgoing packets,
the router will map the LAN host's port and IP address to its own WAN IP
address and a new port.  For incoming packets, the router IP address and
new port will be translated back to the LAN host's IP address and port.  The
translation elements are maintained in the NAT Table.

The following picture represents an example NAT router's network.

                          +--------+
         (206.251.94.210) |   NAT  | (192.168.1.1)
                      +---| router |--------+
                      |   +--------+        | (192.168.1.2)
                      |                +----------+
                      |                | LAN host |
                      |                +----------+
                      |
                      |
                      |
                 +----------+
                 | Internet |
                 +----------+


Configuration:
    1. In file INCLUDE\local.h, define NAT as a preprocessor macro.

        #define NAT

    2. In file NETSRC\nat.c, define NATNETNO to the network interface
        number of your router's external network interface.  This number
        is obtained from examining the netdata table in netconf.c:

        "nat", "int", C, {192,168,1,1}, EA0, 0, Ethernet, NE2000, 0,
            "IRNO=10 PORT=0x300",
        "nat", "ext", C, {206,251,94,210}, EA0, 0, Ethernet, NE2000, 0,
            "IRNO=11 PORT=0x400",

        If the localhostname is "nat", the external interface would be
        on network 1 because it is the second entry with the host's name.
        Therefore, NATNETNO should be 1.

    3. In file NETSRC\nat.c, define NATTABLESZ to an appropriate value
        for your network.  This is determined by examining the requirements
        of the LAN hosts.  For example, if there are 5 LAN hosts and each
        host will open no more than 5 concurrent UDP/TCP communication
        channels with hosts on the Internet, then a maximum of 25 (5x5)
        entries may need to be maintained.  Therefore, NATTABLESZ must be
        defined to 25 to avoid all lost information.

        The table is maintained with a least recently used algorithm, so it
        is possible to reduce the size of the table for local networks with
        intermittent communications.
