Local Parameter Configuration 
=============================================================================

  
  The local.h file configures the following parameters, using the associated
  macro. 
  NNETS             sets the maximum number of network controllers in one   
                    host.                                                   
  NCONNS            sets the maximum number of open logical connections in  
                    one host.                                               
  NCONFIGS          sets the maximum entries in the data structure          
                    netconf, which is a table similar to the netdata        
                    array. Structure netdata is stored in ROM. During       
                    initialization, netdata is copied to netconf, which is  
                    stored in RAM.                                          
  NBUFFS            sets the number of message buffers.                     
  MAXBUF            sets the size of the message buffers.                   
  FRAGMENTATION     sets whether the code to fragment and reassemble IP     
                    packets is included.                                    
  IPOPTIONS         is the IP option support.                               
  USS_IP_MC_LEVEL   sets the IP multicasting conformance level.             
  KEEPALIVETIME     is the Berkeley socket keepalive time.                  
  MIB2              enables the collection of statistics for use with an    
                    SNMP agent.                                             
  RELAYING          defines whether or not host is to relay.                
  chksum_INASM      tells USNET that the checksum routine will be           
                    performed in assembly so the routine in support.c will  
                    not be needed. Not all CPUs supported by USNET have     
                    checksum routine Nchksum() in assembly.                 
  DHCP              specifies if DHCP support code should be included.      
  DNS               specifies if DNS support code should be included.       
  PPP               specifies if PPP support code should be included.       
  LOCALHOSTNAME     obtains USNET's host name.                              
  USERID            identifies a user on an FTP server.                     
  PASSWD            authenticates a user on an FTP server.                  
   [ uss_ip_mc_level  ] 

USS_IP_MC_LEVEL 

=============================================================================
This macro specifies the amount of code to include to support IP
  multicasting. The value is taken from RFC 1112, which defines the following
  IP multicast conformance levels: 
  Level 0:   No support for IP multicasting                                 
  Level 1:   Support for sending but not receiving multicast IP datagrams   
  Level 2:   Support for sending and receiving multicast IP datagrams       
  
  The default setting is 0, which is fine for any system that makes no use of
  multicast IP datagrams. 
  
  Note that in order to receive multicast datagrams through an ethernet
  interface, the device driver for the interface must also include support for
  receiving multicast frames. 


DHCP 

=============================================================================

  
  This macro specifies if DHCP support code should be included, and if it
  should be automatically called as part of the Portinit() function. When the
  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol support is included, the system IP
  address and other parameters can be obtained at start up time from a DHCP
  server. 
  
  The following settings are defined: 
  undefined   No DHCP support code will be included.                        
  1           DHCP support code will be included, but not called            
              automatically. It will be left to the application to make a   
              call to DHCPget() when information from the DHCP server is    
              needed.                                                       
  2           DHCP support code will be included, and DHCPget() will be     
              called as part of Portinit(). Thus, an IP address as will be  
              retrieved and assigned to the network interface when it is    
              brought up.                                                   
  
  The default setting for DHCP is 1. 


DNS 

=============================================================================

  
  This macro specifies if DNS support code should be included, and if it
  should be automatically called when looking up the remote end of a network
  connection. 
  
  The following settings are defined: 
  undefined   No DNS support code will be included.                         
  1           DNS support code will be included, but not called             
              automatically. It will be left to the application to make a   
              call to DNSresolve() when a domain name needs to be looked    
              up.                                                           
  2           DNS support code will be included, and DNSresolve() will be   
              called as part of Nopen() or gethostbyname().                 
  
  The default setting for DNS is undefined. 
  
  Note that a DNS server must be known to the system in order for DNSresolve()
  to succeed. This information can be directly included in the netdata
  structure by setting the DNSVER flag for an entry, or it can be retrieved
  automatically when the DHCPget() function is called. 


PPP 

=============================================================================

  
  This macro specifies if PPP support code should be included. If no change is
  made to the PPP symbol in local.h, then a definition that is set up in net.h
  will be left in place, so this definition must be undefined in local.h in
  order to remove the PPP support. 
  
  So, in order to include the PPP support, the line in local.h that undefines
  the symbol should be commented out like this: 

/* #undef PPP */

  
  In order to exclude PPP support, the symbol must be explicitly undefined,
  like this: 

#undef PPP

  
  The default setting is to exclude PPP support code. 
  
  PPP code will only be needed if the netdata[] structure in netconf.c
  specifies that the system uses PPP as the link layer for at least one of its
  interfaces.
