There are three steps to enable the Proxy ARP capability in USNET:

1.)  Insert the following line into INCLUDE\LOCAL.H:

#define USS_PROXYARP

this will enable the proxy ARP feature in ARP.C and IP.C.

2.)  Add the definitions of the Proxy ARP hosts to the netdata[] table 
in NETSRC\NETCONF.C with the PROXYARP flag in the flags field:

    "net186",  "enet1", C, {206,251,94,253}, EA0, PROXYARP, Ethernet, AMD961, 0,
 "IRNO=4 PORT=0x200",

3.)  You should have at least two interfaces for the local host defined in the 
netdata[] table.  For example, say the local host is named server:

    "server",  "enet0", C, {206,251,94,224}, EA0, 0, Ethernet, NE2000,  0, "IRNO=10 
PORT=0x0300",
    "server",  "enet1", C, {206,251,94,252}, EA0, 0, Ethernet, CS8900,  0, "IRNO=5 
PORT=0x0320 BASE=0xC800",

Note that the port name, which is the second field in the definition, is different 
for the two interfaces defined for the local host and that our proxy ARP host uses 
the port name of the second interface definition.  The order is important.  USNET 
will take the first subnet address match that it finds when it decides where to send 
its messages.

We have added logic to IP.C to scan the table for the proxy ARP host and its 
matching interface definition on the local host.  So we need to have the "other" 
interface specified first in the table so that USNET will find that when it scans 
for the subnet address match.

To test this feature, you need two hosts connected to each other on a dedicated 
network with the host doing the proxy ARP also connected to a second network.  You 
can build mttest with both hosts acting as servers so that when they start up they 
will just monitor their networks.  Use another host on the second network to send 
a ping to the host that is on the dedicated network.

The host on the dedicated network should respond to the ping that should be 
indicated by a ping reply message.  After the ping has executed, the ARP cache 
(use arp -a) on the sending host should have a new entry with the IP address of 
the host on the dedicated network and the ethernet address of the proxy ARP host.
