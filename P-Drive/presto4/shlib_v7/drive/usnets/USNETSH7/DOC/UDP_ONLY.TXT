This document describes how to run USNET in UPD only
mode.  UDP only mode implies the transport layer for
USNET can only be UDP.  TCP has been removed.

  MODIFICATION HISTORY:

  06-AUG-1998  NJW  Added comments on supported protocols

SETUP:
======

  The following steps describe how to create a UDP
  version of USNET.

    1.  Delete or remove TCP.C from the NETSRC directory.
    
    2.  Remove reference to file TCP from the NETSRC makefile.
    
    3.  Add the line:
    
           #undef TCP
           
        to the bottom of LOCAL.H in the INCLUDE directory.
        This line also needs to be added to the local.h files
        found in each of the DRVSRC\$(CPU) directories.  $(CPU)
        refers to directories I8068, I386, PPC, and so on.

  If you have purchased the UDP only version of USNET,
  the above steps have already been performed. 

SUPPORTED PROTOCOLS:
====================

  Several of USNET's high level protocols are only supported
  with TCP/IP and not UDP.  Therefore the following USNET
  high level protocols with not run under a UDP only
  version of USNET:

     FTP.C        File Transfer Protocol

  The following USNET high level protocols do use UDP only
  and will therefore run:

     BOOTP.C      Bootstrapping Protocol
     DHCP.C       Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
     DNS.C        Dynamic Name Service (in USSW's IAP product)
     TFTP.C       Trivial File Transfer Protocol
        
TEST PROGRAMS:
==============

  Only the following USNET test programs will run
  under the UDP version of USNET:
  
        ping    Uses ICMP/IP.
        fttest  FTP client/server test program 
        sotest  BSD socket API test program
        
  Programs ping and sotest will run without modification.
  Program fttest must be run with the "-u" option to
  signal the use of UDP.  This will cause fttest to transfer
  a file using TFTP.  To have fttest run as a server, 
  issue the following command:
  
    C:\> fttest -u
    
  To run fttest as a client on a remote machine, issue
  the following command:
  
    C:\> fttest -u <server>
    
  where <server> is the host name configured for the
  server machine.  See the USNET manual for further
  documentation concerning fttest.
